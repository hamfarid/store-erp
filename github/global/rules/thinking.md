# 🧠 Thinking Framework Rules

## Purpose
Think systematically, not randomly. Break down problems, analyze deeply, make informed decisions.

## Core Principle
**Think before you act. Plan before you code. Analyze before you decide.**

## Thinking Process

### 1. Understand
- What is the problem?
- What is the goal?
- What are the constraints?

### 2. Analyze
- Break down into components
- Identify dependencies
- Find patterns

### 3. Plan
- Design solution
- Consider alternatives
- Choose best approach

### 4. Execute
- Implement systematically
- Test continuously
- Document thoroughly

### 5. Review
- Does it work?
- Is it optimal?
- Can it be improved?

## Always Ask
- Why? (Understand purpose)
- What if? (Consider alternatives)
- How? (Plan implementation)
- What could go wrong? (Risk analysis)

## Remember
**Good thinking leads to good code. Bad thinking leads to bad code.**

Think deeply. Act wisely.
