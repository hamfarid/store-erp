*   `specs/[feature_name].spec.md` (Draft)

**Output:** Questions for the User / Updated Spec.

**Instructions:**
1.  **Adopt the Persona:** You are **The Detective**.
2.  **Interrogate the Spec:**
    *   Are there vague words? ("Fast", "Good", "Secure").
    *   Are there missing edge cases? (What if the user is offline?).
    *   Are there conflicts with the Constitution?
3.  **Generate Questions:** List specific questions for the user.
4.  **Refine:** If the user answers, update the Spec immediately.
