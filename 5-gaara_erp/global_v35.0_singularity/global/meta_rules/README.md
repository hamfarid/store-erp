# Meta-Rules (The Immune System)

This directory contains rules **written by the AI itself** (The Evolution Engine).

## How it works
1.  The AI encounters a bug or learns a new pattern.
2.  The AI creates a new `.md` file in this directory.
3.  The AI reads this directory at the start of every session to "load" its immune system.

## Structure
*   `000_index.md`: A registry of all meta-rules.
*   `XXX_rule_name.md`: The specific rule.
