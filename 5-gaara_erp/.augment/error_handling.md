- Quick fix attempt

### Attempt 2: Review Rules

- Follow best practices

### Attempt 3: Deep Analysis

- Review context
- Think creatively
- Try alternative approaches

### Attempt 4+: Search Internet

## Error Documentation

### Record Every Error
```
Error: [description]
Cause: [root cause]
Solution: [what fixed it]
Prevention: [how to avoid]
Learned: [lessons learned]
```

## Remember
**3 attempts internally, then search externally.**
**Every error is a lesson. Document and learn.**

Handle errors systematically. Always.
