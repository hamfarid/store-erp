# RULE 14: NO DUPLICATE FILES

**You must not create files with similar names or content.**

- **Before creating a new file,** search for existing files with similar names.
- **If a similar file exists,** read its content and decide whether to modify it or create a new one.
- **If you create a new file,** ensure that it has a unique and descriptive name.
- **Do not use suffixes** like `_fix`, `_clean`, `_enhanced`, `_simple`, or `_unified`.
- **Always aim to merge** functionality into existing files rather than creating new ones.
