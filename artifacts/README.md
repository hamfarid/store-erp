# Testing Artifacts (RORLOC)

This directory is generated by the automated RORLOC test suite.

## Files

- `site-map.json`  Snapshot of frontend routes visited during tests, with load-time metrics and basic metadata.
- `ui-inventory.json`  Per-route counts of key UI elements (buttons, inputs, links, tables).
- `api-inventory.json`  Snapshot of API calls observed during navigation (method, path, status, ok flag).
- `baseline-issues.json`  Baseline console errors, page errors, and failed API requests.
- `db-schema.json`  Introspected database schema (tables, columns, primary keys, foreign keys).
- `screenshots/`  Full-page screenshots for key routes and viewports.

All files are safe to regenerate at any time by running the Playwright RORLOC tests:

```bash
cd frontend
npx playwright test tests/e2e/record.spec.js tests/e2e/responsive-baseline.spec.js
```

These artifacts are meant for analysis and should normally be ignored by application code.
