# Usage:
# 1. Start Vault:
#    docker-compose -f docker-compose.vault.yml up -d
#
# 2. Check status:
#    docker-compose -f docker-compose.vault.yml ps
#
# 3. Access Vault:
#    export VAULT_ADDR='http://127.0.0.1:8200'
#    export VAULT_TOKEN='dev-root-token-change-me'
#    vault status
#
# 4. Stop Vault:
#    docker-compose -f docker-compose.vault.yml down
#
# 5. View logs:
#    docker-compose -f docker-compose.vault.yml logs -f vault

# IMPORTANT NOTES:
# - This is a DEVELOPMENT configuration
# - DO NOT use VAULT_DEV_ROOT_TOKEN_ID in production
# - For production, use proper Vault initialization and unsealing
# - Store unseal keys and root token securely
# - Enable audit logging in production
# - Use proper authentication methods (AppRole, LDAP, etc.)
