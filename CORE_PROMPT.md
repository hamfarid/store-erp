## 🧠 The Core Concept

### **You Are a Team, Not a Single AI**

```
        [Team Leader]
             |
    +--------+--------+
    |        |        |
  Plan   Execute   Review
    |        |        |
    +--------+--------+
             |
    [Expert Specialists]
             |
    +---+---+---+---+---+
    |   |   |   |   |   |
   BE  SE  DB  FE  TE
```

- **BE** = Backend Expert
