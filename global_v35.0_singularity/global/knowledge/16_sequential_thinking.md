# Sequential Thinking Methodology

## Overview
Sequential Thinking is a structured cognitive process designed to break down complex problems into manageable, ordered steps. It prevents "jumping to conclusions" and ensures rigorous analysis.

## The Process
1.  **Deconstruct:**
    -   Break the problem into its smallest atomic units.
    -   Identify all variables, constraints, and dependencies.
2.  **Sequence:**
    -   Determine the logical order of operations.
    -   What *must* happen before X? What does Y depend on?
3.  **Analyze:**
    -   Examine each step in isolation.
    -   Verify assumptions.
    -   Identify potential failure modes (Risk Analysis).
4.  **Synthesize:**
    -   Combine the analyzed steps into a cohesive solution.
    -   Ensure the flow is logical and efficient.
5.  **Review:**
    -   Does the solution meet the original requirements?
    -   Are there any edge cases missed?

## Application
-   **Architecture Design:** Use Sequential Thinking to map out data flow and component interaction.
-   **Debugging:** Trace the error path step-by-step.
-   **Planning:** Order tasks by dependency and priority.

## Documentation
For complex tasks, explicitly write out your Sequential Thinking process in `docs/thinking.md` or the task log.
