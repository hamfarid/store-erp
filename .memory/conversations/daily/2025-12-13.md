### Actions Taken (15:00:30 - 16:00:00)

#### 1. Created ARCHITECTURE.md ✅
**File:** `/home/ubuntu/Store - 13-12-2025/docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`

**Content:**
- System Overview
- Architecture Principles (Separation of Concerns, Single Responsibility, DRY, Security First, Scalability)
- Technology Stack (Python/Flask, React, SQLAlchemy)
- System Components (Backend, Frontend structures)
- Database Schema (28 tables, 50+ indexes)
- API Architecture (RESTful, JWT)
- Frontend Architecture (React Router, TailwindCSS)
- Security Architecture (RBAC, 68 permissions, 7 roles)
- Naming Conventions
- Coding Standards

**Impact:** Provides clear architectural reference for all developers

---

#### 2. Created Task_List.md ✅
**File:** `/home/ubuntu/Store - 13-12-2025/docs/Task_List.md`

**Content:**
- 8 Phases with detailed breakdown
- 200+ tasks organized by phase
- Progress tracking (39% complete)
- Success criteria
- Current vs Target metrics
- Next actions timeline

**Old Task List:** Moved to `Task_List_OLD.md` (142 security tasks from previous audit)

**Impact:** Clear roadmap for completing the project

---

#### 3. Created Memory System Structure ✅
**Directories Created:**
```
.memory/
├── conversations/      # All user interactions
├── decisions/          # Major decisions with OSF analysis
├── checkpoints/        # Project state snapshots
├── context/            # Current task context
└── learnings/          # Lessons learned

logs/
├── application/        # Application logs
├── security/           # Security events
├── performance/        # Performance metrics
└── errors/             # Error logs
```

**Impact:** Complete memory and logging infrastructure ready

---

### Decisions Made

#### Decision #1: Prioritize UI/UX Redesign
**Rationale:**
- Current UI/UX score is 31/100 (lowest score)
- Biggest impact on overall project score
- User-facing, highly visible
- Can be done in parallel with backend improvements

**Alternatives Considered:**
1. Start with testing (rejected - less visible impact)
2. Start with security hardening (rejected - already 75/100)
3. Start with performance optimization (rejected - already 70/100)

**Chosen Approach:** UI/UX redesign after Memory & Logging systems

---

#### Decision #2: Create New Task List
**Rationale:**
- Old task list had 142 security-focused tasks
- New approach is holistic (UI/UX, Testing, Docs, Security)
- Better alignment with GLOBAL_PROFESSIONAL_CORE_PROMPT
- Clearer phase structure

**Action:** Moved old to `Task_List_OLD.md`, created new comprehensive list

---

#### Decision #3: Implement Memory System First
**Rationale:**
- Foundation for all other work
- Enables proper tracking and learning
- Required by GLOBAL_PROFESSIONAL_CORE_PROMPT
- Supports decision documentation

**Impact:** All future work will be properly documented

---

### Outcomes

**Files Created:**
1. ✅ `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` (comprehensive architecture documentation)
2. ✅ `docs/Task_List.md` (200+ tasks across 8 phases)
3. ✅ `.memory/` structure (5 subdirectories)
4. ✅ `logs/` structure (4 subdirectories)

**Progress:**
- Phase 1: 100% ✅
- Phase 2: 100% ✅
- Phase 3: 100% ✅
- Overall: 39% (78/200 tasks)

**Next Phase:** Phase 4 - Memory System Implementation

---

### Knowledge Gained

1. **GLOBAL_PROFESSIONAL_CORE_PROMPT Structure:**
   - 73+ specialized prompts
   - 7 distinct roles (Architect, Developer, Tester, etc.)
   - Core principles: Certainty, OSF, Automation, Logging
   - Memory system with 5 components
   - Logging system with structured approach

2. **Project State:**
   - Backend is solid (95/100)
   - Frontend functionality is good (85/100)
   - UI/UX needs complete redesign (31/100)
   - Documentation needs expansion (50/100)
   - Testing needs significant work (30/100)

3. **Best Approach:**
   - Infrastructure first (Memory, Logging)
   - Then UI/UX (biggest impact)
   - Then Testing & Quality
   - Finally Release
