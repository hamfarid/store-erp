# 🎯 Context Engineering Rules

## Purpose
Understand requirements deeply. Extract all information. Build complete context.

## Core Principle
**Context is everything. Without full context, you make wrong decisions.**

## Context Building

### 1. Gather Information
- Read all provided documents
- Ask clarifying questions
- Check existing code
- Review previous decisions

### 2. Understand Requirements
- Functional requirements
- Non-functional requirements
- Constraints
- Success criteria

### 3. Identify Stakeholders
- Who will use this?
- Who will maintain this?
- Who depends on this?

### 4. Map Dependencies
- What does this depend on?
- What depends on this?
- External dependencies?
- Internal dependencies?

### 5. Build Mental Model
- How does everything fit?
- What's the big picture?
- Where are the risks?
- What's the critical path?

## Always Consider
- User perspective
- Developer perspective
- Business perspective
- Technical perspective

## Remember
**Full context = Good decisions. Partial context = Bad decisions.**

Build complete context. Always.
