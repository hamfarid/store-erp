- disease: Tomato_Bacterial_spot
  plant_type: Tomato
  symptoms:
    - small dark water-soaked spots on leaves
    - spots enlarge and become angular
    - centers of spots may dry and fall out (shot-hole effect)
    - yellow halo around spots
    - spots on stems and fruit (raised, scab-like)
  treatments:
    - Use disease-free seeds/transplants.
    - Rotate crops (avoid planting tomatoes/peppers in the same spot for 2-3 years).
    - Apply copper-based bactericides preventatively.
    - Improve air circulation.

- disease: Tomato_Late_blight
  plant_type: Tomato
  symptoms:
    - large, dark, water-soaked lesions on leaves, often with pale green border
    - white fuzzy mold on underside of leaves in humid conditions
    - dark, greasy-looking lesions on stems
    - firm, dark, greasy lesions on fruit
    - rapid plant collapse in favorable conditions
  treatments:
    - Use resistant varieties.
    - Destroy infected plants immediately.
    - Apply fungicides preventatively and curatively (e.g., chlorothalonil, mancozeb, specific oomycete fungicides).
    - Ensure good drainage and air circulation.

- disease: Fusarium_Wilt_Tomato
  plant_type: Tomato
  symptoms:
    - yellowing of lower leaves, often starting on one side of the plant or leaf
    - wilting, especially during the hottest part of the day
    - stunting of plant growth
    - brown discoloration inside the stem when cut lengthwise near the base
  treatments:
    - Use resistant varieties (marked VFN, etc.).
    - Crop rotation (long rotations needed, 5-7 years).
    - Soil solarization in some climates.
    - Maintain optimal soil pH (around 6.5-7.0).
    - No effective chemical cure once infected.

- disease: Powdery_Mildew_General
  plant_type: Various (e.g., Cucumber, Squash, Roses)
  symptoms:
    - white powdery patches on leaves, stems, and sometimes flowers/fruit
    - leaves may yellow and dry out
    - distorted growth in severe cases
  treatments:
    - Use resistant varieties.
    - Improve air circulation, prune crowded growth.
    - Apply fungicides (e.g., sulfur, potassium bicarbonate, neem oil, specific synthetic fungicides).
    - Remove and destroy infected plant parts.
